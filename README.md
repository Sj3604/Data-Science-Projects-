## 🚀 Project Workflow
1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Handling missing values  
   - Encoding categorical variables  
   - Scaling numerical features  

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Distribution of sales and products  
   - Correlation analysis  
   - Visualizations for insights  

3. **Modeling**
   - Applied machine learning models  
   - Evaluated performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and other metrics  

4. **Results**
   - Best model selected based on evaluation metrics  
   - Business insights derived from data
